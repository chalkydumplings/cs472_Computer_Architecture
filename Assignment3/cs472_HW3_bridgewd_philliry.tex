\section*{$(3.1)$} Why is the program counter a pointer and not a counter?
  
\section*{$(3.2)$} Explain the function of the following registers in a CPU.

a. PC
b. MAR
c. MBR
d. IR

\section*{$(3.3)$} For each of the following 6-bit operations, calculate the values of the C, Z, V, and N flags.

a.

\section*{$(3.10)$} Why does the ARM provide a reverse subtract instruction RSB r0,r1,r2 that implements [r0] = [r2] - [r1] when the normal subtraction instruction SUB r0,r2,r1 will do exactly the same job?

\section*{$(3.17)$} 

\section*{$(3.18)$} Write one or more ARM instructinos that will clear bits 20 to 25 inclusive in register r0. All the other bits of r0 should remain unchanged.

\section*{$(3.19)$} This is a classic problem of assembly language programming. Write a sequence of ARM instructions that swap the contents of registers r0 and r2 without using any additional registers or memory storage (that is, you can't move r1 to a temporary location).

\section*{$(3.25)$} What is the binary encoding of the following instructions?

a. STRB r1, [r2]

b. LDR r3, [r4, r5]!

c. LDR r3, [r4], r5

d. LDR r3, [r4,\#-6]!

\section*{$(3.39)$} Write an ARM assembly language program that scans a string terminated by the null byte 0x00 and copies the string from a source location pointed at by r0 to a destination pointed at by r1.

\section*{$(3.51)$} Write an ARM assembly language program to determine whether a string of characters with an odd length is a palindrome (for example, mom) under the following constraints.

a. The string of ASIC-encoded characters is stored in memory.

b. At the start of the program, register r1 contains the address of the first character in the string, and r2 contains the address of the last character. On exit from the program, register r0 contains a 0 if the string is a not a palindrome, and 1 if it is.
